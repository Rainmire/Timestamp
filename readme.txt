Outputs the time in seconds since last run.
Creates a timestamp of the current instant and compares it to a previously saved timestamp properties file(appProperties), 
then overwrites with current timestamp. Uses a blank default properties file (defaultProperties) if no previous save exists.

Will be used later.
